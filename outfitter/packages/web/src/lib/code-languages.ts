// Grammars for syntax-colouring fenced code in the transcript (Markdown.tsx's rehype-highlight).
// A hand-picked set instead of lowlight's "common" 37: the languages agents actually write in
// coding sessions, which halves what the session page downloads. A fence tagged with anything
// else renders as plain monospace, same as before highlighting existed.
